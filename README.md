# Sub-hourly historical weather data with DarkSky API

Hacky way to collect sub-hourly (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 30 mins) weather data from : https://darksky.net/dev, API request formats: https://darksky.net/dev/docs.
N.B.:Dark Sky has recently joined Apple, so new registration to collect API key is no longer available.
